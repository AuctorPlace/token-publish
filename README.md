# Auctor Place
The "AuctorPlace" platform allows e-book authors to make money without going through a publisher, thereby lowering the barriers to entry for new authors, ensuring the rights of authors forever, facilitating the sharing of excellent e-books among readers through commentaries and compensating those who write the commentaries, allowing a space for the authorâ€™s critics and readers to coexist, and focuses on making it possible for e-books to be applied to new works and generate profits. To implement this, the "AuctorPlace" platform will provide various systems as described above for users, and will enable "AuctorPlace" coins to be utilized within the "AuctorPlace" platform to create value for everyone that participates in the platform. The coins can be used to buy e-book data and will be distributed to e-book data authors, critics, etc., and its value can be recognized by exchanging it in the coin market. 
We promise to contribute in creating a healthy e-book market by implementing a continuously developing e-book platform based on the "AuctorPlace" platform and "AuctorPlace" coin.
